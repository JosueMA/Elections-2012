Poll of polls of the 2012 Mexican presidential election
-------------------------------------------------------

Execute run-all.R to recreate the analysis

If you want the interactive chart to work put the file clean-data/json.txt in the electometer/js/ directory and then view the file index.html in the electometer directory  (may require a local http server to work properly).

This code is based in part on replication code provided by Simon Jackman available at his [homepage](http://jackman.stanford.edu/oz/).
