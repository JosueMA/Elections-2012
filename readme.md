Poll of polls of the 2012 Mexican presidential election
-------------------------------------------------------

Execute run-all.R to recreate the analysis. Since the program uses JAGS you'll won't be able to run it using windows (I used Ubuntu to run the analysis)

If you want the interactive chart to work put the file clean-data/json.txt in the electometer/js/ directory and then view the file index.html in the electometer directory  (may require a local http server to work properly).

This code is based in part on replication code provided by Simon Jackman available at his [homepage](http://jackman.stanford.edu/oz/).

Poll data taken from [ADN Pol√≠tico](http://www.adnpolitico.com/encuestas) (with the exception of Indemerc)
